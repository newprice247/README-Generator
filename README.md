# README Generator - Module 9 Challenge

## Description

The goal of this project was to build an application that would use user-input to quickly and easily create a proffesional README.

## Finished Project

### Comments

* Once the user downloads the required node packages, they will utilize node.js to initialize the app in the terminal.
* Once initialized, the app runs through a series of prompts, collecting information from the user about their project such as the title, description, installation instructions, how to use it, the license they chose, how to contribute to the project, and how to get in touch with them with questions about the project.
* Once the user has finished the questionaire, a proffesional README is created using markdown, and containing all of the information the user provided.
